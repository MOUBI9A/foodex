- **Animations**: Smooth curves (AnimationsV2)
- **Shadows**: Material elevation system

### UX Patterns
- **F-Pattern Layout**: Natural eye movement
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Gradual information reveal
- **Visual Feedback**: Animations confirm actions
- **Mobile-First**: Pull-refresh, FAB, gestures

### Marketing Psychology
- **Social Proof**: Ratings, reviews, badges
- **Urgency**: Countdown timers, limited offers
- **Color Psychology**: Orange (appetite), Green (trust)
- **FOMO**: Exclusive badges, time-limited deals
