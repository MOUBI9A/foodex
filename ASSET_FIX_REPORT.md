# 🐛 Asset Error Fixes - FoodEx

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Issue**: Multiple asset loading errors on iOS app launch  
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The iOS app was running but showing numerous errors:
```
Unable to load asset: "assets/img/shopping_cart.png"
Unable to load asset: "assets/img/dropdown.png"
Unable to load asset: "assets/img/search.png"
... (20+ similar errors)
```

Additionally:
- Multiple RenderFlex overflow errors (layout issues)
- App launched but with broken UI

---

## 🎯 Root Cause

**Asset Path Mismatch:**
- Code referenced images at: `assets/img/`
- Actual images were at: `assets/images/`
- Font paths in `pubspec.yaml` were incorrect: `assets/fonts/` instead of `assets/font/`

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Renamed Assets Directory
```bash
mv assets/images assets/img
```
- Moved all images to match code expectations
- No code changes needed (60+ files would need updating otherwise)

### 2. Updated pubspec.yaml
**Before:**
```yaml
assets:
  - assets/images/
  - assets/fonts/
  - assets/icons/

fonts:
  - family: Metropolis
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/fonts/Metropolis-Regular.otf
```

**After:**
```yaml
assets:
  - assets/img/
  - assets/font/

fonts:
  - family: Metropolis
    fonts:
      - asset: assets/font/Metropolis-Regular.otf
```

### 3. Fixed iOS Runner Script
**Issue**: Script was using `-d ios` which doesn't match actual device UUID

**Fix**: Extract actual device ID from `flutter devices` output
```bash
IOS_DEVICE=$(flutter devices | grep -i "ios" | head -1 | sed 's/.*• \([^ ]*\) •.*/\1/')
flutter run -d "$IOS_DEVICE" --debug --hot
```

## ⚠️ Remaining Issues to Address

### Layout Overflow Errors
Multiple RenderFlex overflow warnings detected:
- "A RenderFlex overflowed by 171 pixels on the right"
- "A RenderFlex overflowed by 129 pixels on the right"
- "A RenderFlex overflowed by 29 pixels on the bottom"

**Cause**: UI components not properly constrained for different screen sizes

**Recommended Fix**:
1. Wrap overflowing widgets with `Expanded` or `Flexible`
2. Use `SingleChildScrollView` for content that may overflow
3. Implement responsive design with `MediaQuery`
4. Test on various screen sizes (iPhone SE, iPhone 16 Plus, iPad)

**Files to Review**:
- `lib/presentation/widgets/*.dart` (widget components)
- `lib/presentation/pages/home/*.dart` (home screen layouts)
- `lib/presentation/pages/menu/*.dart` (menu item layouts)

---

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **Assets:**
   - Renamed: `assets/images/` → `assets/img/`

2. **Configuration:**
   - `pubspec.yaml` (updated asset paths)

3. **Scripts:**
   - `run-ios.sh` (fixed device ID detection)

## ✨ Next Steps

### High Priority:
1. ⏳ Fix RenderFlex overflow errors
2. ⏳ Test on different iPhone screen sizes
3. ⏳ Verify all UI screens load correctly

### Medium Priority:
4. Update dependencies (33 packages have newer versions)
5. Add error boundaries for image loading failures
6. Implement placeholder images for missing assets

### Low Priority:
7. Add asset generation script
8. Create image optimization pipeline
9. Add SVG support for scalable icons
