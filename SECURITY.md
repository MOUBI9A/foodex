## Reporting a Vulnerability

The FoodEx team takes security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability?

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@foodex.ma](mailto:security@foodex.ma).

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

### What to Include in Your Report

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

### What to Expect

After you submit a report, here's what happens:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

2. **Initial Assessment**: Our security team will assess the reported vulnerability and determine its severity and impact. We'll provide an initial assessment within 5 business days.

3. **Investigation**: We'll investigate the vulnerability in depth, working to:
   - Understand the full scope of the issue
   - Identify all affected versions
   - Develop a fix or mitigation

4. **Fix Development**: We'll develop a fix and test it thoroughly. Timeline depends on severity:
   - **Critical**: 1-2 weeks
   - **High**: 2-4 weeks
   - **Medium**: 4-8 weeks
   - **Low**: 8-12 weeks

5. **Disclosure**: Once a fix is ready:
   - We'll release the fix in a new version
   - We'll publish a security advisory
   - We'll credit you in the advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
