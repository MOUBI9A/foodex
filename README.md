FoodEx connects customers with local home chefs through a polished, multi-platform Flutter app inspired by Moroccan aesthetics. The project now runs on a unified Clean Architecture stack‚Äîlegacy `lib/view/*` files have been removed so every screen lives under `lib/presentation/pages` or `lib/features`.

---

## ‚ú® Feature Highlights
- **Customers:** curated menu browsing, secure wallet with MAD currency, order tracking, reviews, and personalized recommendations.
- **Home Chefs:** menu/product management, live order queue, pantry inventory, analytics, and earnings dashboards.
- **Delivery Drivers:** assignment queue, optimized routing, payout tracking, and availability toggles.
- **Admins:** dashboard widgets for revenue, orders, health metrics, and system alerts (see `lib/features/admin`).

Extended feature descriptions live in [`docs/FEATURES_DOCUMENTATION.md`](docs/FEATURES_DOCUMENTATION.md).

| Android   | `flutter run -d android` or `./run-android.sh`                           |
| iOS       | `flutter run -d ios` (requires `cd ios && pod install` the first time)   |
| Web       | `flutter run -d chrome` or `./run-web.sh`                                |
| macOS     | `flutter run -d macos` or `./run-macos.sh`                               |
| Windows   | `flutter run -d windows` or `run-windows.bat`                            |

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture Snapshot
- **Pattern:** Clean Architecture with explicit `core`, `data`, `domain`, `features`, and `presentation` layers.
- **State:** Provider-based presenters plus emerging Riverpod providers where finer-grained reactivity is required.
- **Navigation:** GoRouter scaffolding (`lib/core/routes/app_router.dart`) ready for full adoption; temporary `Navigator` routes live in `lib/core/constants/routes.dart`.
- **Networking:** `dio` and `http` clients with websocket helpers, backed by environment configs in `lib/core`.
- **Storage:** Hive for structured caches and SharedPreferences for lightweight persistence.
- **Realtime & System Services:** `web_socket_channel`, `local_db_service.dart`, `api_service.dart`, and `service_locator.dart` handle IO + dependency injection.
- **Design System:** Metropolis & Poppins fonts, `lib/core/theme(s)` for colors/spacing, and reusable widgets in `lib/presentation/widgets`.

Detailed diagrams live in [`docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`](docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) and [`docs/MIGRATION.md`](docs/MIGRATION.md).

## ‚úÖ Testing & Quality
```bash
flutter test                         # unit + widget tests
flutter test --coverage              # with lcov output
flutter drive --target=integration_test/test_app.dart   # integration/e2e
dart run tool/ci_checks.sh           # lint + formatting + tests bundle
```
- Widget and provider suites live in `test/unit` and `test/widget`.
- Integration harnesses are under `integration_test/`.
- Mock helpers reside in `test/test_helpers/`.

---

## üì¶ Tooling & Scripts
- `scripts/fix_all_imports.sh` / `scripts/comprehensive_import_fix.sh`: repair package imports after moves.
- `scripts/final_import_fixes.sh`: shortcut for CI-ready import cleanup.
- `push_to_github.sh`, `run.sh`, and platform-specific launchers simplify common workflows.
- `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` plus `docs/TESTING_DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md` cover release steps.
