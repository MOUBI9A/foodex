# FOODEx Documentation

Welcome to the FOODEx technical documentation.

## Available Guides

### [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) ðŸ”„
Complete guide for the Phase 3 architecture migration:
- New project structure (feature-first)
- GoRouter navigation patterns
- Riverpod state management
- How to add new features
- Testing strategies
- Migration checklist

**Start here if you're new to the codebase or upgrading from an older version.**

## Quick Start

### For New Developers

1. Read [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) to understand the architecture
2. Check `lib/features/` for examples of feature modules
3. Review `lib/core/constants/routes.dart` for navigation
4. See `test/widget/` and `test/unit/` for testing patterns

### For Existing Contributors

If you've worked on FOODEx before Phase 3:
- `lib/view/*` is **deprecated** â€” use `lib/features/` or `lib/presentation/pages/`
- Navigation now uses **GoRouter** â€” see route examples in MIGRATION.md
- State management is **Riverpod-first** â€” providers are in `{feature}/providers/`
- All data uses **Hive** for offline-first persistence

---

## Architecture Overview

```
Presentation Layer (UI)
    â†“
Feature Modules (business logic + screens)
    â†“
Providers (Riverpod state)
    â†“
Repositories (data access)
    â†“
Local DB (Hive) + Mock Data
```

---

## Key Technologies

- **Flutter 3+** â€” UI framework
- **GoRouter 14+** â€” Declarative routing
- **Riverpod 2+** â€” State management
- **Hive** â€” Offline-first local storage
- **Material 3** â€” Design system (with custom tokens)

## Project Structure

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Shared utilities, theme, constants
â”œâ”€â”€ data/           # Models, repositories, mock data
â”œâ”€â”€ features/       # Feature modules (customer, chef, admin)
â”œâ”€â”€ presentation/   # Shared UI layer
â””â”€â”€ main.dart       # App entry with GoRouter + Riverpod
```

See [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md) for detailed structure.

## Getting Help

1. **Architecture questions** â†’ [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md)
2. **Code examples** â†’ Check `lib/features/*/screens/` for patterns
3. **Testing** â†’ See `test/widget/` and `test/unit/`
4. **Navigation** â†’ Review `lib/core/constants/routes.dart`
